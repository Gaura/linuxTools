When an AWK program contains the BEGIN pattern without another special pattern, 
AWK will not expect any further command line input and exit. Typically, when an 
AWK program is executed on the command line, without the BEGIN special pattern, 
AWK will continue to expect input until you exit by typing CTRL-D. The example 
Hello World! program below will print and immediately exit.

with awk the following code will work
BEGIN {print "Hello World!"}
in an awk file but without begin it will not.

To run an awk file use awk -f filename
